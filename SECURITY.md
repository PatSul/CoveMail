# Security Policy

## Reporting

Report vulnerabilities privately to the maintainers (do not open a public issue first).

## Scope

Priority areas:

- Secret leakage (keychain, logs, config, or memory dumps)
- OAuth token handling
- Unsafe external requests or unexpected data exfiltration
- SQL injection or local cache corruption risks
- HTML/email rendering vulnerabilities

## Expectations

- No telemetry in security workflows
- Minimal and explicit network usage
- Strong defaults with clear user consent for cloud AI
